# Project Motivation
Usually personal stories don't come in READMEs, but this one can be a little different. My dad owned a small business that went under when I was a kid. He had some signs that he was going under, but I don't know if he recognized them, particularly not the financial ones. With this project, I am hoping to find the factors that can help other small businesses to find some warning signs in their businesses, and can help later on with doing some changing of how their business is structured or start a new change in business operations to increase the factors that help a sucessful business. 

# Problem Statement
Is there any features from this dataset that will help predict if a company is going to go under, and if there is one that stands out, why? What model produces the best results, and why might that model be the best?  

# Metrics used to determine this? 

# Required Libraries 
1. pandas
2. matplotlib
3. sklearn
4. pickle

# File Structure
* Bankrupt_EDA.ipynb
* constants.py
* models
    * Models that are saved via pickle package.

# Project Origin and Related Datasets
The data was gathered through this (Kaggle dataset)[https://www.kaggle.com/fedesoriano/company-bankruptcy-prediction]. The dataset originated from the Taiwan Econmic Journal from the years 1999 to 2009. The data was obtained from (UCI Machine Learning)[https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Taiwanese+Bankruptcy+Prediction] library. As seen in their documentation for the Kaggle dataset.
